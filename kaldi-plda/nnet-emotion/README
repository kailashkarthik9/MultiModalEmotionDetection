1) It assumes a built version of Kaldi and that the root emotion directory is unzipped
within kaldi/egs/voxceleb/v2 (as all the references to Kaldi files are relative from there).

2) It requires several different corpora to train both the emotion detector and emotion converter;
it is the expectation of the code that these corpora live unzipped with their native file structure
unchanged in kaldi/egs/voxceleb/v2/emotion/corpora.  When possible, the code automatically downloads
corpora -- those cases are noted below.

To kick off training of the various neural nets (the base speaker identification model and all
the variants of the augmented emotion detection model), please run:
scripts/[TO DO]

NOTE that this requires the following diffs to native Kaldi files: kaldi_diffs/

To kick off scoring of the various neural nets (all the variants of the augment emotion detection 
model), please run:
scripts/[TO DO]

To use a pretrained model to detect the emotion of any .wav file, please run:
